### Homework 9

# Logging in the sheets

I was able to run demo.js to log a dummy temperature variable into the google sheet.

I then modified temp.js to take tmp101 sensor data and publish it to the same google sheet.

Here are some of the values I recorded:

    Time	    Temperature (F)
    43770.51853	72.8366
    43770.5187	77.5616
    43770.51887	75.3116
    43770.51905	74.075
    43770.51922	73.625
    43770.5194	73.4
    43770.51957	73.175

Here is a link to the sheet I used.
