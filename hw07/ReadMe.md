# Homework 7

I have included the leds.js file that is used to run this hw.

## Blynk part 1

I was able to get the virtual switch to toggle and the virtual LED to work.

Here is my output:
        ___  __          __
       / _ )/ /_ _____  / /__
      / _  / / // / _ \/  '_/
     /____/_/\_, /_//_/_/\_\
            /___/
    
      Give Blynk a Github star! => https://github.com/vshymanskyy/blynk-library-js

## Blynk part 2

The slide switch works properly.

Here is my output

        ___  __          __
       / _ )/ /_ _____  / /__
      / _  / / // / _ \/  '_/
     /____/_/\_, /_//_/_/\_\
            /___/
